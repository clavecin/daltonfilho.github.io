    <!-- ABOUT START -->

    <h2 id="about">About</h2>

    <p>This comparative tutorial aims to make the bridge between wxWidgets and Swing to allow for Swing developers to
        use their experience to learn the toolkit. Unlike other tutorials that assume some familiarity with C++ GUI
        toolkits, it focuses on aspects that might be tricky or unusual to developers accustomed to Swing, deliberately
        bypassing distracting or repetitive instructions. Once the differences are digested and the basics are grasped,
        wxWidgets will become familiar and you will be able to proceed on your own without problems.

        <!-- ABOUT END -->

        <!-- STORY START -->

    <h2 id="story">How this tutorial came about</h2>

    <p>While in college, I've played with C++ driven by pure curiosity, reimplementing data-structures to learn the
        basics of the language. However, there was a frustrating aspect about this exploration, as the results of my
        efforts were mere kid-play compared to what I could do in Java at the time. Moreover, data-structures exposed me
        to only a narrow subset of programming problems compared to what one usually finds while developing non-trivial
        GUI applications. Wherever I looked for the source code of a GUI application written in C++, the code would seem
        alien to me. I shied away from C++ for years until about a year after my graduation, when I was invited for a
        C++ project that used wxWidgets as the GUI toolkit. </p>
    <p>Having wxWidgets as my first real C++ &quot;programming canvas&quot; taught me that I learn much more when I'm
        doing something useful with what I'm learning. This reward is encouraging and leads to more exploration, which
        leads to more rewards, ad infinitum. wxWidgets may very well be the difference between knowing something of C++
        or nothing at all for developers who would never consider learning the language without being able to create
        GUIs with it. If you are inexperienced in C++ and if you never considered developing a GUI application with it,
        wxWidgets might give the momentum you need to explore more features of the language, as well as opening your
        mind to the advantages of C++ when it comes to desktop applications. </p>

    <!-- BASIC SETUP START -->

    <h2 id="basic_setup">Basic setup</h2>

    <p>I use the configuration below throughout this tutorial:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/" target="_blank">wxWidgets 2.6</a></li>

        <li><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/products/cplusplus/" target="_blank">NetBeans IDE</a> - you may also use
            the trendier <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> or any other IDE of your
            choice if you know how to build C++ applications with it
        </li>
        <li>GCC 4.1.2 - I don't guarantee everything will work on other versions</li>
        <li>Any linux flavor - you may use wxWidgets in other platforms, but this tutorial will focus on the GTK build;
            note that the Windows build has a <a
                    href="http://www.daltonfilho.com/2008/02/23/wxwidgets-on-windows-using-netbeans-60-with-mingw-msys/">different
                setup</a> I will not cover here
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>You may change the setup as you wish, but you will need to know what you are doing. This tutorial does not
        require advanced C++ skills, but if you feel you need to put yours in shape, this <a
                href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/" target="_blank">website</a> is the best I know for this
        purpose.</p>

    <!-- BASIC SETUP END -->

    <!-- INSTALLING WX START -->

    <h2 id="installing_wx">Installing wxWidgets</h2>

    <p>Note: if your wxWidgets is properly installed and configured, you can skip this section.</p>


    <p>The first thing you need to do is to make sure wxWidgets is properly installed and configured. You can easily
        check the status of your installation by compiling and linking the <a
                href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/docs/tutorials/hello.htm" target="_blank">hello world</a> found on
        wxWdidgets' website (the compile and link command is right at the bottom). Please don't try this on your IDE at
        this point because it might introduce path configuration problems. If it does not compile or link, something
        might be wrong with your setup. You might want to try the <span class="monospaced">wx-config --cxxflags</span>
        and <span class="monospaced">wx-config --libs</span> commands to see if they output anything. </p>

    <p class="command">
        I must admit I had a tough time using wxWidgets for the first time on my machine because the automated
        installation provided by my Ubuntu did not install it correctly. A manual installation solved everything. If you
        need to compile wxWidgets as I had, the instructions that come with the sources are very clear and should
        present no problems to get going. You should look for support on Google or support forums if you still have
        problems at this point. </p>

    <!-- INSTALLING WX END -->

    <!-- SETTING UP NETBEANS START -->

    <h2 id="netbeans_setup">Setting up NetBeans</h2>

    <p>In this section we will create a new C++ project on NetBeans, as well as configuring the compiler and linker
        flags for the program. As the C\C++ Development Pack is not bundled by default with NetBeans, you need to <a
                href="http://www.netbeans.org/products/cplusplus/" target="_blank">download</a> and install it if you
        don't have it already. Once you have it installed, follow the steps below: </p>
    <ol>

        <li><span class="monospaced">File</span> --> <span class="monospaced">New Project</span>... [Ctrl + Shift + F]
        </li>
        <li>Select <span class="monospaced">C/C++ Project</span> | <span class="monospaced">C/C++ Application</span> on
            the <span class="monospaced">New Project</span> dialog [<a href="new-project.png"
                                                                       target="_blank">screenshot</a>]
        </li>

        <li>Fill in the <span class="monospaced">New C/C++ Application</span> dialog fields [<a href="new-project-2.png"
                                                                                                target="_blank">screenshot</a>]
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>With the project already created, the compiler and linker options need to be set-up. wxWidgets needs libraries
        and include directories that would be a strain to configure manually, but fortunately it comes with a small <a
                href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/wiki/index.php/Wx-Config" target="_blank" title="wx-config">utility
            program</a> that outputs all those directories and other options. You should use it to configure compiler
        and linker options: </p>


    <p class="caption">wxWidgets compiler options</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Right click on project name on the <span class="monospaced">Projects</span> panel --> <span
                class="monospaced">Properties</span></li>
        <li>On the Project Properties dialog select <span class="monospaced">C/C++</span> --&gt; <span
                class="monospaced">C++ Compiler</span> --&gt; <span class="monospaced">Command Line </span></li>

        <li>Add <span class="monospaced">`wx-config --cxxflags`</span><span class="command"> to the list of <a
                href="compiler-flags.png" target="_blank">additional options</a></span></li>
    </ol>

    <p class="caption">wxWidgets linker options</p>

    <ol>
        <li>On the Project Properties dialog select <span class="monospaced">C/C++</span> --&gt; <span
                class="monospaced">Linker</span> --&gt; <span class="monospaced">Command Line </span></li>
        <li>Add <span class="monospaced">`wx-config --libs`</span><span class="command"> to the list of <a
                href="linker-flags.png" target="_blank">additional options</a></span></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now the project is almost configured, but you still have to decide whether you will put all headers and sources
        in separate directories or not. If you choose the former, be sure to include the headers directory in the list
        of include directories (<span class="monospaced">C/C++</span> --&gt; <span
                class="monospaced">C++ Compiler</span> --&gt; <span class="monospaced">General</span> in the <span
                class="monospaced">Project Properties</span> dialog). You will see a folder for source files and another
        for header files in the projects panel, but these don't map to any folder in your disk, so make sure you add
        header and source files to their appropriate directories whenever you create or add these files to your project.
    </p>

    <!-- SETTING UP NETBEANS END -->

    <!-- THE MAIN CLASS START -->

    <h2 id="main_class">The main class </h2>

    <p>You know that in C, C++ and Java every program starts in <span class="monospaced">main()</span>, however, if you
        take a look at the source code of many wxWidgets applications, you won't find <span
                class="monospaced">main()</span>. This is not an obscure C++ hack, it's just a simple indirection, after
        all, nothing implies that you should always create your own <span class="monospaced">main()</span>. For example:
        a Java desktop framework may create its own <span class="monospaced">main()</span> and call an interface
        implemented by you during start-up. wxWidgets has a similar approach, although it still allows you to create
        your own <span class="monospaced">main()</span> if you will, though this is usually not recommended because it's
        less portable. This section will use the recommended way, though you can see <a
                href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_appinifunctions.html#wxentry" target="_blank">how to use
            your own <span class="monospaced">main()</span></a> if you're interested. </p>

    <p> To create a wxWidgets application without a <span class="monospaced">main()</span>, you have to derive the <a
            href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_wxapp.html" target="_blank">wxApp</a> class and override the
        <span class="monospaced">OnInit()</span> method. That's it! The listing below demonstrates how simple it is:
    </p>

    <details class="code-block" open>
        <summary class="caption">my_app.h</summary>
        <pre class="language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp">#ifndef _MY_APP_H
#define _MY_APP_H

#include &lt;wx/app.h&gt;

class MyApp : public wxApp {

    virtual bool OnInit();

};

#endif</code></pre>
    </details>

    <details class="code-block" open>
        <summary class="caption">my_app.cc</summary>
        <pre class="language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp">
#include &quot;my_app.h&quot;

bool MyApp::OnInit() {
    return true;
}

IMPLEMENT_APP(MyApp);</code></pre>
    </details>

    <p>You should include these on your project, and after that it should build without problems, but before you try to
        run it, you should be aware of the following quirks:

    <ul>
        <li><strong>return type of <span class="monospaced">OnInit()</span></strong> &#8212; an <span
                class="monospaced">OnInit()</span> with nothing besides a <span class="monospaced">return false</span>
            statement is equivalent to <span class="monospaced">main()</span> with an <span
                    class="monospaced">exit(1)</span> only, whereas <span class="monospaced">return true</span> as the
            only statement in <span class="monospaced">OnInt()</span> yields a zoombie program that does nothing besides
            waiting to be killed;
        </li>

        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>IMPLEMENT_APP</strong></span> &#8212; this macro creates the <span
                class="monospaced">main()</span> function for you and invokes your overridden <span class="monospaced">OnInit()</span>.
            You can check the header of <span class="monospaced">wxApp</span> if you're curious about what this macro
            does, or if you want to check for alternative macros. You <em>must</em> declare this macro if you're not
            going to provide your own <span class="monospaced">main()</span>, and this declaration <em>must</em> be in
            the implementation section of your <span class="monospaced">wxApp</span> derived class (for the same reason
            you don't put <span class="monospaced">main()</span> in the header). For instructions on how to create a
            wxWidgets program with your own <span class="monospaced">main()</span>, check <a
                    href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_appinifunctions.html#wxentry" target="_blank">this
                page</a>;
        </li>

        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>argc and argv</strong></span> &#8212; if you need <span class="monospaced">argc</span>
            and <span class="monospaced">argv</span>, <span class="monospaced">wxApp</span> has homonymous instance
            variables you can use anywhere in your <span class="monospaced">wxApp</span> implementation;
        </li>

        <li><strong class="monospaced">#include &lt;wx/app.h&gt;</strong> &#8212; to find out which header corresponds
            to which class, just check the &quot;included files&quot; section of the API doc of the class in question.
            If you are unsure of which class to pick, try picking a class by its <a
                    href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_classesbycat.html#classesbycat" target="_blank">category</a>.
            You can also try using the generic <span class="monospaced">&lt;wx/wx.h&gt;</span> if you want to take
            advantage of <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/stable/wx_cpp.html#precompiledheaders"
                            target="_blank">precompiled headers</a> or if you want to make your refactorings a little
            easier.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>You may <a href="swingwx_myapp.tar.gz">download</a> the source code of this section.</p>

    <!-- THE MAIN CLASS EMD -->

    <!-- THE TOP FRAME START -->

    <h2 id="top_frame">The top frame</h2>


    <p>Now it's time to show a frame. You know that in Java you can either construct a <span
            class="monospaced">JFrame</span> and set its properties externally or you can derive a <span
            class="monospaced">JFrame</span> and set its properties internally. In wxWidgets you can also create a <span
            class="monospaced"><a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_wxframe.html#wxframe" target="_blank">wxFrame</a></span>
        both ways, with the choice depending on how you want to encapsulate the widgets contained by the frame. The
        listings below compare the external configuration style in wxWidgets and Swing:</p>


    <details class="code-block" open>
        <summary class="caption">External configuration of wxFrame</summary>
        <pre class="language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp">#include &quot;my_app.h&quot;

#include &lt;wx/frame.h&gt;

bool MyApp::OnInit() {
    wxFrame *frame = new wxFrame((wxFrame*) NULL, wxID_ANY, _T(&quot;Hello world&quot;), wxPoint(100, 100), wxSize(320, 240));

    frame->Show(true);

    return true;
}

IMPLEMENT_APP(MyApp);</code></pre>
    </details>

    <details class="code-block" open>
        <summary class="caption">External configuration of JFrame</summary>
        <pre class="language-java"><code class="language-java">import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class MyApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Hello world&quot;);

        frame.setBounds(100, 100, 320, 240);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

}</code></pre>
    </details>


    <p>As expected, you will see a <a href="hello_window.png">window</a> if you try to build and run the program. Before
        moving on to the internal configuration style (which will be used throughout this tutorial), I need to explain 3
        parameters on wxFrame's <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_wxframe.html#wxframector"
                                   target="_blank">constructor</a> that might look peculiar from a Swing developer's
        perspective: </p>


    <ul>
        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>(wxFrame*) NULL</strong></span> &#8212; in Swing you never assign parents
            to top level containers, whereas <span class="monospaced">wxFrame</span> requires you to define one since
            <span class="monospaced">wxFrame</span> is not a &quot;top level container&quot; in the Swing sense of the
            word. Use <span class="monospaced">(wxFrame*) NULL</span> whenever you need to indicate that the window does
            not have a parent. You might want to use <span class="monospaced">wxApp</span>'s <span class="monospaced"><a
                    href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_wxapp.html#wxappsettopwindow" target="_blank">setTopWindow()</a></span>
            as well. You need to do that <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_cpp.html#null"
                                            target="_blank">cast</a> for portability issues;
        </li>

        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>wxID_ANY</strong></span> &#8212; in Swing you don't have to provide IDs for
            components, and if you need some identification, you would probably use <span
                    class="monospaced">Component</span>'s <span class="monospaced">setName()</span>. In wxWidgets you
            have the choice of providing an ID of your own or letting wxWidgets choose the ID with <span
                    class="monospaced"><a
                    href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/stable/wx_eventhandlingoverview.html#windowids"
                    target="_blank">wxID_ANY</a></span>. If you want to provide the ID yourself, it must be smaller than
            <span class="monospaced">wxID_LOWEST</span> and greater than <span
                    class="monospaced">wxID_HIGHEST</span> to be valid. But why, after all, you need to provide an ID?
            Answer: because wxWidgets' event handling system needs them to assign behaviors to components. This may
            seem obvious to programmers not used to the listener model for event handling, but as a Swing developer
            just make sure you understand that there's no <span class="monospaced">addFooListener()</span> in
            wxWidgets. We'll see that in more detail on the <a href="#events_table">event handling</a>
            section;
        </li>

    <h2 id="widgets_sizers_absolute">Widgets &amp; Sizers - Absolute Layout</h2>

    <p>Adding widgets in wxWidgets using an absolute layout is very different from Swing. The first notable difference
        is that you should define the parent of a component on its constructor instead of using a method like <span
                class="monospaced">add(Component)</span>. As we will see on the next section, you will use a method that
        do resembles <span class="monospaced">Component</span><span class="preprocessor">'s </span><span
                class="monospaced">add(Component)</span> when you use a layout manager in wxWidgets, but you still have
        to define the parent of the component when you construct it. The second difference is that all widgets use
        absolute layout by default, unlike Swing where every component has its own default layout manager. The final
        notable difference is that if you are not going to use a layout manager (a.k.a. sizer in wxWidgets),
        constructing the component is enough to add it to its parent (because it is defined on the child's constructor).
        The code sample below illustrates this concept: </p>

    <p>It is clearly visible that wxWidgets makes it very easy to configure components in absolute layouts. Note,
        however, that absolute layouts are <a href="http://www.leepoint.net/notes-java/GUI/layouts/nulllayout.html"

    <p>The previous section demonstrated how to add panels into a frame using no layout manager, but for the most part
        you want your layout to adjust gracefully to resizing. This is when sizers (the equivalent to Swing's layout
        managers) come into play. This section will demonstrate this by adding two panels to a frame, where both panels
        have to share the space of the frame equally and maintain a fixed distance of 20 pixels from each other and from
        the frame's borders. Both the panels and the frame have to maintain a minimum size as well. The code samples
        below demonstrate this layout in Swing and wxWidgets: </p>

        sizers in wxWidgets; Swing, on the other hand, requires you to <s>guess</s> define this size manually</p>

    <p>As you can see, it took more lines of code to get the same result in the higher level Swing. To make things
        worse, in Swing I had to use another container to achieve the same result and the added struts do not use the
        system color. I would have to spend even more lines of code to make each strut transparent. Comparisons aside,
        let's briefly analyze the wxWidgets code to see how the layout specifications translate to Swing: </p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>wxBoxSizer(wxHORIZONTAL)</strong></span> &#8212; the equivalent to <span
                class="monospaced">BoxLayout</span>'s <span class="monospaced">X_AXIS</span>, while <span
                class="monospaced">wxVERTICAL</span> is the equivalent to <span class="monospaced">BoxLayout</span>'s
            <span class="monospaced">Y_AXIS</span>;
        </li>

        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>wxPanel(this, wxID_LEFT_PANEL)</strong></span> &#8212; as in the Swing
            code, there was no need to configure size and location since the layout to be used is not absolute, however,
            since the next section will handle events of this panel, I had to define an ID (remember to include it in
            your header or <a href="swingwx_sizers.tar.gz">download</a> the source code of this section if you are in
            doubt);
        </li>
        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>sizer-&gt;SetSizeHints(this)</strong></span> &#8212; makes the minimum size
            of the parent (in this case, <span class="monospaced">this</span>) match the minimum size of the sizer. You
            must use this method if you don't want to allow the parent of the sizer to become smaller than the minimum
            size of the sizer;
        </li>

        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong> sizer->Add(leftPanel</strong></span> &#8212; as <a href="#widget_parent">previously
            mentioned</a>, you define the parent of the widget on its constructor, <em>not</em> here. This argument
            merely adds the component to the sizer's &quot;responsibility&quot;, the sizer does not become the parent;
        </li>
        <li><em>(cont.)</em> <span class="monospaced"><strong>true</strong></span> &#8212; allows the component to
            expand <em>horizontally</em>, whereas <span class="monospaced">false</span> would maintain the component on
            its minimum size <em>horizontally</em>. Note that if the sizer were vertical, the rules would apply <em>vertically</em>
            instead of <em>horizontally</em>;
        </li>

        <li><em>(cont.)</em> <span class="monospaced"><strong>wxEXPAND</strong></span> &#8212; same as above, but
            vertically: using <span class="monospaced">wxEXPAND</span> implies that the widget can expand
            <em>vertically</em>, whereas not using it retains the component on its minimum size <em>vertically</em>. If
            the sizer were vertical, the rules would apply <em>horizontally</em>;
        </li>

        <li><em>(cont.)</em> <span class="monospaced"><strong>wxTOP | wxBOTTOM | wxLEFT, 20</strong></span> &#8212;
            check the documentation of <span class="monospaced">wxSizer</span>'s <a

            <span class="monospaced">wxBOTTOM</span> and <span class="monospaced">wxLEFT</span> define where the margins
            of the left panel should be, while the last argument defines the length of this margin. Note that I did not
            use <span class="monospaced">wxRIGHT</span> because a spacer was added on its right, and for the same reason
            I did not use <span class="monospaced">wxLEFT</span> on the right panel;

    <p>Now, to finish this section, let's add one button to each panel. The buttons have to maintain a minimum size
        while still being able to stretch horizontally. They have to keep centered on the panels and should preserve a
        minimum distance of 20 pixels from their parent's borders. The following code samples implement these

    <p>The code in this section may not be very useful, but it's more than enough for you to start using sizers. Note
        that the goal here is comprehension: once you get the idea of how the box sizer works in wxWidgets, you can do
        most of your layouts with simple compositions. Other methods of <span class="monospaced">wxSizer</span> are very
        similar to their equivalents in Swing and should pose no problems for you to understand. </p>

    <!-- EVENT HANDLING - EVENT TABLE START -->

    <h2 id="events_table">Event handling - Event Tables </h2>

    <p>If you have ever written any sizeable Java desktop program, you have probably written <em>tons</em> of event
        handling classes. A Java class may contain dozens of inner classes piled over each other to handle events of an
        arbitrary number of components. While this may sound familiar to you, this style of event handling is still
        weird to many people. It may have been strange to you while you were learning Java, but at this stage of the
        game this is probably a long forgotten impression. Event handling in wxWidgets is something that will bring back
        that awkward feeling, but as soon as it pass it will look just as natural as event handling in AWT/Swing.</p>
    <p>wxWidgets offers more than one way to write event handling code. The most traditional one is based on <em>event
        tables</em>, which are preprocessor macros where you associate an event with a handler method. The following
        code samples demonstrate simple event handling in Swing and its equivalent in wxWidgets using event tables: </p>

    <p>Event tables are really easy to use once you grasp the basic rules, which are detailed below:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>DECLARE_EVENT_TABLE()</strong></span> &#8212; you should always declare
            this macro in the class declaration if you are going to use event tables. You should prefer declaring it at
            the bottom because there might be unexpected results <a
                    href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_eventhandlingoverview.html#eventintroduction"
                    target="_blank">otherwise</a>;
        </li>

        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>BEGIN_EVENT_TABLE(MyFrame, wxFrame)</strong></span> &#8212; the beginning
            of the event table, where the two arguments are the class name and the class type;
        </li>
        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>EVT_BUTTON</strong></span> &#8212; the declaration of an event-handler
            mapping. EVT_BUTTON is a macro used to map a button click event to a member method that will handle this
            event. This macro is one of the <a
                    href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_wxcommandevent.html#wxcommandevent" target="_blank">wxCommandEvent</a>
            macros, which define event mappings for other event types. In case you're wondering how you are going to
            find which macro corresponds to which event, have a look at the wxWidgets <a
                    href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_classref.html#classref" target="_blank">API docs</a>
            and search for classes with <span class="monospaced">wxFooEvent</span> names;
        </li>

        <li><em>(cont.)</em> <span class="monospaced"><strong>(wxID_LEFT_BUTTON, </strong></span> &#8212; this is the
            exact reason why we have assigned IDs to the buttons a few code snippets ago: to map events of this widget
            to member functions in an event table. Note that not all macros require the ID of the widget that originates
            the events: some macros like <a class="monospaced"
                                            href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_wxsizeevent.html#wxsizeevent"
                                            target="_blank">wxSizeEvent</a>'s <span
                    class="monospaced">EVT_SIZE</span> assume you are handling resize events of the class for which the
            event table is declared;
        </li>
        <li><em>(cont.)</em> <span class="monospaced"><strong>MyFrame::changeParentPanelColor)</strong></span> &#8212;
            the member function that will handle the event. The restrictions for this method are explained in more
            detailed below in this list. Have a look at the next section for a discussion of this possibility to use
            methods instead of objects to handle events;
        </li>

        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>END_EVENT_TABLE()</strong></span> &#8212; guess what... it's the end of the
            event table :-);
        </li>
        <li><span
                class="monospaced"><strong>void MyFrame::changeParentPanelColor(wxCommandEvent &amp;event)</strong></span>
            &#8212; the rules for member functions that handle events have some similarities with listeners' methods in
            Java, whereas some others are very different: the method must be void (like Java), can have any name (not
            like Java), must take an argument of the event type it will handle (like Java) and it must not be virtual
            (not like Java). To find the exact type of the event object you need, use the same strategy you use for
            finding event macros: look for <span class="monospaced">wxFooEvent</span> classes in the API docs. If the
            <span class="monospaced">wxFooEvent</span> class declared an <span class="monospaced">EVT_FOO</span> macro,
            then the member method that will handle this event has to receive a <span
                    class="monospaced">wxFooEvent</span> reference;
        </li>

        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>event.Skip()</strong></span> &#8212; if you comment this call to see what
            happens you will see that the next event for this same widget on the table will not be called, i.e., if you
            comment <span class="monospaced">event.Skip()</span> in <span
                    class="monospaced">changeParentPanelColor()</span>, <span
                    class="monospaced">showHelloMessage()</span> will not be called when you press the right button. You
            have to call <a class="monospaced" href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_wxevent.html#wxeventskip"
                            target="_blank">Skip()</a> to make the event processing system to continue to search for
            another event handler bound to this event. If you think this is boring, you should try using a single method
            to handle events of a given widget (something like <span class="monospaced">onLeftButtonClicked()</span>).
            Then, inside the method, you can distribute the event to the appropriate handler methods (pretty much like
            the way it was done in the Swing example of this section);
        </li>

        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>event.GetEventObject()</strong></span> &#8212; the equivalent to <span
                class="monospaced">EventObject</span>'s <span class="monospaced"><a
                href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/EventObject.html#getSource()" target="_blank">getSource()</a></span>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may have noticed that the example contains other features of wxWidgets like a color chooser panel (the
        equivalent to <span class="monospaced">JColorChooser</span>) and a simple dialog message (the equivalent to
        <span class="monospaced">JOptionPane</span>). These are explained in more detail in the wxWidgets list of
        convenience <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_dialogfunctions.html#dialogfunctions"
                       target="_blank">dialog functions</a>. </p>

    <!-- EVENT HANDLING - EVENT TABLE END -->

    <!-- EVENT HANDLING - CONNECT START -->

    <h2 id="events_connect">Event handling - Connect()</h2>

    <p>Event tables are great because they are lean and save a lot of typing &#8212; but in contrast with what? The
        other way to handle events: <span class="monospaced">Event</span>'s <span class="monospaced">Connect()/Disconnect()</span>.
        You may wonder why does anyone bother using it if event tables are so advantageous. There are three basic
        reasons: first, event tables use macros, and that doesn't fit everyone's taste; secondly, event tables do not
        allow event handling to take place in some other object; finally, event tables are static and do not allow event
        handlers to be defined at runtime (which is default in Java). With that in mind, one could say that <span
                class="monospaced">Connect()/Disconnect()</span> are in fact more familiar to a Swing programmer than
        event tables, and they don't just <em>look</em> familiar, they <em>do</em> allow you to do everything you do
        with listeners in Java. In spite of all this versatility and power, it eludes me that the official wxWidgets
        documentation reserves little room to explain the advantages of this style of event handling, even though the
        authors themselves <a href="http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/2007/01/in-praise-of-connect.html" target="_blank">have
            done so</a>. Without further ado, let's see how it works. </p>

    <p class="subtitle">Fig. 5. Showing properties of MouseEvent and the analogous wxMouseEvent </p>

    <p>The <span class="monospaced">Connect()</span> signature in the example deserves special attention: </p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="monospaced"><strong>leftPanel->Connect(</strong></span> &#8212; left panel is the component
            whose events you will listen;
        </li>

        <li><em>(cont.)</em> <span class="monospaced"><strong>wxEVT_LEFT_DOWN</strong></span> &#8212; the ID of the
            event you want to listen. To find this ID, look for a <span class="monospaced">wxFooEvent</span> class on
            the API docs such as <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_wxmouseevent.html#wxmouseevent"
                                    target="_blank"><span class="monospaced">wxMouseEvent</span></a> (<a
                    href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_classesbycat.html#classesbycat" target="_blank">this
                page</a> has all event classes grouped). On the page, look for the right side of the &quot;Event table
            macros&quot; table: this is where the event IDs are. Note that these are NOT the same as the macro names,
            which are not preceded by wx;
        </li>

        <li><em>(cont.)</em> <span
                class="monospaced"><strong>wxMouseEventHandler(MyFrame::showMouseCoordinates)</strong></span> &#8212;
            the function that will handle the event, which has to follow all the rules for handler functions discussed
            on the previous section. The <span class="monospaced">wxMouseEventHandler</span> macro that encloses the
            function converts this function to the correct type that can handle this event. The rule is pretty simple:
            for a <span class="monospaced">wxFooEvent</span> you will handle, enclose the function on this argument with
            a <span class="monospaced">wxFooEventHandler</span> macro.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>if there were an exact Java equivalent of <span class="monospaced">Connect()</span> with those arguments, it
        would be called &quot;addLeftButtonPressedListener()&quot;, but there's no such possibility. When you care for a
        single event, or not all events of the listener API, you derive an adapter like <span class="monospaced">MouseAdapter</span>,
        which provides void implementations of all API of the listener, allowing you to scope the events you're
        interested in. Contrastingly, wxWidgets allows for event handling on a per-method basis, which can be quite
        convenient, but it's not that automagic: the class from which this method is member must derive <span
                class="monospaced">wxEvtHandler</span>, and the method must follow the rules of event handler methods
        described in the previous section. Since <span class="monospaced">MyFrame</span> derives <span
                class="monospaced">wxEvtHandler</span> (indirectly), it was OK to leave aside the last two arguments of
        <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6/wx_wxevthandler.html#wxevthandlerconnect" target="_blank"><span
                class="monospaced">Connect()</span></a>, but if you want to handle events from another class, these two
        last arguments must be used. For example: </p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>While using Swing and wxWidgets it's difficult to refrain oneself from comparisons: Java's progress bar can be
        resized but wxWidgets' cannot, whereas the latter's color dialog has a color picker which the former has not,
        and so on. Despite the many bindings of wxWidgets, the choice of one over the other is often a choice between
        Java and C++, which is not always trivial. The objective of this comparative tutorial was not to provide an <em>or</em>,
        but an <em>and</em> to the toolkit that developers with a Java background have to solve problems. Once both
        toolkits are learned, the developer will have a <em>choice</em> and will be able to take advantage of the best
        that both toolkits have to offer. </p>
