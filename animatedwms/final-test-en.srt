This is a concept OpenLayers application created to test animated WMS layers provided by GeoServer's WMS animator

2
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:11,082
Users can visualize the evolution of maximum temperatures over a period of 7 days

3
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:16,019
Rendering an animated WMS layer is a costly operation for GeoServer

4
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:28,484
Users can visualize the evolution of specific temperature ranges

5
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:56,507
Let's visualize other temperature ranges in a warmer period...

6
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:14,176
An even warmer period...

7
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:20,998
Animations are orchestrated by the aparams and avalues parameters

8
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,350
The aparams controls which WMS property will be the basis of the animation

9
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,149
The avalues defines the value of this property for each frame of the animation

10
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:33,205
In this application I defined aparams as cql_filter

11
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:38,029
Which implies that for every frame of the animation, a CQL query has to be specified

12
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:50,753
Interpolations were rendered at a very low resolution (600x259)

13
00:01:50,753 --> 00:02:00,886
So edges are bound to look jagged if zooming forces the layer to be rendered beyond its native resolution (this has nothing to do with the animator)

14
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:10,009
Behavior of animated WMS layers is identical to their static counterparts in OpenLayers...

15
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:36,250
Let's test a full screen animation...

16
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,882
GeoServer startup parameters: -Xmx8192m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
